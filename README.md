Lab 07: Vanilla HTTP Server
======

**Author:** Jennifer Piper

This is a very basic HTTP server using node.js.

## Getting Started

Create a .env file in the root of this repo with the following content:

```
NODE_ENV = development;
PORT = 3000;
```
From the command line in a node.js environment, from the root of this repo, enter these commands to start the server on port 3000:
* `npm i`
* `npm start`

To use the app, navigate a browser to `http://localhost:3000` .
